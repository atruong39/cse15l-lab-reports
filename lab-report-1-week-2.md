# CSE 15L: SSH Tutorial

Hello CSE 15L students! In this tutorial, we will go over how to log into your course-specific account on `ieng6` through SSH. If you are on Windows, then a preliminary step is to install OpenSSH. Follow this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) and follow the instructions. 

## Step 1: Install VS Code

Follow this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the VS Code installer for your platform, and run it:

## Step 2: Find Your Course-Specific Account

Follow this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and enter your student information. On the next page, you will see a section called "Additional Accounts." Look for one in the the following format: 

```
cs15lwi22xxx
```

The `xxx` part of this string should be some other combination of letters or number unique to you. This string will be your username for `ieng6`. For this tutorial, we will using my username `cs15lwi22afi` as an example. 

## Step 3: Connect Remotely 

Open VS Code and open a terminal by either using Ctrl or Command + `, or by Terminal â†’ New Terminal in the toolbar.

Then enter the following command:

```
$ ssh cs15lwi22afi@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Since this is likely your first time connecting to this server, you will likely get a message like this: 

![Image](./step3b.png)

Type `yes` and press enter to continue. If you would like to learn more about the meaning of this message, follow this [link](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084). 

Then type and enter your password. Be aware that when typing your password, no characters will appear on screen. Once logged in you will see something like this:

Congratulations, you have just connected to a computer in the basement of the CSE building! Now you can run commands on this computer. 

## Step 4: Trying Out Commands

Some basic commands you should try out are `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp`. Try to figure out what each one does. 

For example, here is the output for `ls`:

The `ls` command lists all files in the current working directory. 

## Step 5: Moving Files with `scp`

Something important to working remotely is the ability to copy files between local and remote computers. `scp` is a handy command which allows you to copy files from your computer to a remote computer. 

First we will log off of `ieng6` by hitting Ctrl + D or by entering the command `exit`. Now create a file on your local computer called `WhoAmI.java` in your current working directory with the following contents:

```
class WhoAmI {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
  }
}
```

Compile and run the file using `javac` and `java`. You should see your usename on your computer: 

![Image](./step5a.png)

Now type the following command: 

```
$ scp `WhoAmI.java` cs15lwi22afi@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/
```

Once you enter the password for your `ieng6` account. This will be the following output:

![Image](./step5b.png)

The file `WhoAmI.java` was copied over to `ieng6`! Now you can connect through `ssh` and look for the file with `ls`. Then compile and run the file, just like you did on your local machine. However, this time, the output will be your username on `ieng6`:

Next we will talk about how to expeite the process of working with remote computers. 

## Step 6: Setting an SSH Key

So far, we have had to use our password several times and after a certain point it can become tedious. A solution to this is using `ssh` keys which create a pair of files called a *private key* and a *public key*. You copy the *public key* onto a specific location on the server, and the *private key* in a specific location on the client. Then, `ssh` can use these files instead of your password. 

To start, enter the following command: 

```
$ ssh-keygen
```

Press enter when prompted for a file and passphrase. The output should be something like this:

![Image](./step6a.png)

If you are on Windows, then you will also need to the extra `ssh-add` steps at this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation).

This created your public and private key files on your computer, stored in the `.ssh` directory. Now we need to copy the public key file to the `.ssh` directory of your account on `ieng6`:

![Image](./step6b.png)

If done correctly, you should now be able to log into `ieng6` without the need to enter your password:

![Image](./step6c.png)

Notice how after the `ssh cs15lwi22afi@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command, there is no prompt for a password! 

## Step 7: Optimizing Remote Running

There are few more tricks that can help speed up your remote workflow. A handy trick is the ability to send a single command to a remote computer using quotation marks, after the `ssh` command. So, for example, using this command 

```
$ ssh cs15lwi22afi@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"
```

This is the following output: 

![Image](./step7a.png)

Neat! It listed the files in the home directory on the remote computer. 

You can run multiple commands using semicolons:

```
cp WhoAmI.java WhoAmICopy.java; javac WhoAmICopy.java; java WhoAmICopy 
```
